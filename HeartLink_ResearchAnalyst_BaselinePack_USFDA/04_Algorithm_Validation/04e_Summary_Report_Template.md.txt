# HeartLink Synthetic Validation Summary Report

## Trial ID: [e.g., LLC_BASELINE_TRIAL_001]
**Algorithm Versions:** v3.6 vs v3.7  
**Number of Scenarios:** 15  
**Execution Date:** [Timestamp]  
**Executed By:** Joshua Gunnels, PA-C

### 1. Objective
To verify that algorithm v3.7 (shadow mode) produces identical categorization to v3.6 baseline.

### 2. Methods
Synthetic scenarios representing common and edge cases of heart-failure symptom patterns were executed through both algorithms.  
Outputs were compared for category and normalized score deltas.

### 3. Results
| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Total scenarios | 15 |
| Concordant | 15 |
| More conservative | 0 |
| Less conservative | 0 |

### 4. Conclusion
No discrepancies were detected between v3.6 and v3.7 shadow outputs.  
Algorithm validated as functionally equivalent for release readiness.
