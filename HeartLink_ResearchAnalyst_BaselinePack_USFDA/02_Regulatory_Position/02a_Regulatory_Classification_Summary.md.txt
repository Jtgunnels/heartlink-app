# Regulatory Classification Summary — HeartLink

## 1. Current Status
HeartLink qualifies as a **General Wellness Product** under the FDA’s “General Wellness: Policy for Low Risk Devices” (January 2023, CDRH).  
It does not perform diagnosis, prediction, or treatment of any disease.  
All outputs are educational and informational.

## 2. Rationale for Exemption
- No physiological sensors are used.
- Data remain local to the user’s device.
- Messaging language avoids diagnostic or triage terms.
- Users are directed to consult their clinician for interpretation.

## 3. Future Regulatory Transition
If HeartLink adds functions that:
- identify or prioritize users for clinical review, or
- interface with clinical decision systems,
then the product would enter the **Software as a Medical Device (SaMD)** domain under 21 CFR § 820 and require FDA clearance (likely Class II, 510(k) or De Novo).

## 4. Next Steps
This baseline documentation ensures all design controls are maintained now, so future submission will require only validation data and labeling updates rather than rebuilding compliance evidence.
