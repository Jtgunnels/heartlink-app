# Study Objectives and Background

## 1. Purpose
This document defines the primary objectives and rationale for HeartLink’s algorithm development and validation program.

HeartLink is a clinician-developed mobile application designed to improve patient self-monitoring for heart-failure–related symptoms.  
The system encourages daily symptom check-ins (shortness of breath, swelling, fatigue, and weight change) and uses an internal scoring algorithm to classify wellness zones for self-awareness and provider communication.

## 2. Goals
1. Support self-management and early recognition of symptom changes.
2. Provide educational, non-diagnostic trend summaries for patients.
3. Establish an FDA-compliant documentation baseline for potential future SaMD transition.

## 3. Scope
This baseline pack covers all design, regulatory, validation, and clinical-correlation documents necessary to demonstrate Good Software Practice (GSP) and 21 CFR 820.30 compliance.

## 4. Rationale
Current heart-failure management guidelines (AHA/ACC/HFSA 2022) emphasize patient engagement and early reporting of symptoms. HeartLink’s educational scoring model aims to facilitate these behaviors without performing automated clinical decision-making.
